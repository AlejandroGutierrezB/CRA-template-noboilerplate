# cra-template-nbp

No boilerplate version for starting CRA

See [full guide on how to make yourself](https://dev.to/pending).

## Usage

```bash
npx create-react-app %PROJECT_NAME% --template nbp
```

Or

```shell script
yarn create react-app %PROJECT_NAME% --template nbp
```

`npx` command installs most recent stable version of CRA from npm. `--template` parameter points to this template, note that `cra-template-` prefix is omitted.

## Motivation

I use Create React App pretty much often. I am sure that many are already sick of dealing with erasing all the boilerplate every time you start a new react project with CRA.
This is the most basic template posible, so that anybody can use.
I wanted to learn and show how to do it in an [article](https://dev.to/pending), so from here everyone can create their own version to their liking.
